In my liri bot app, there are three commands.

1. to find song, type the command "spotify-this"

2. to find a movie, type the command "movie-this"

3. to find a concert event, type tho command "concert-this"

I got some sort of deprecation error with my spotify function but the song titles still show up in the terminal
